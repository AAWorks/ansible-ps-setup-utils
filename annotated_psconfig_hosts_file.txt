# This is an Ansible inventory file in INI format. You can define a list of
# hosts and groups to be managed by this particular inventory.
#
# Connection information can be added to groups, more information is
# documented at:
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html
#
# A way to check that all of your expected hosts are accessable is:
# ansible all -m ping --ask-become-pass --> extremely useful
# --> use -vvv to expand any pop-up errors
#
# Full perfSONAR hosts inventory grouped by installation bundle
